======== Project structure (Best Practices)

https://www.tektutorialshub.com/angular/angular-folder-structure-best-practices/
	Root Module
		The Angular requires one module to be loaded as the application starts. We call this as root module. The root module loads the root component and all other modules
	Feature Module
		The Features Module implements a specific feature of the Application. All the components, pipes & directives which implement the feature become the part of the module.
	Shared Module
		There are many components, directives & pipes, which we may like to share across various modules. All these components should go into shared module.
		The shared module and must declare the components, pipes and directives using the declarations metadata and export it using the exports metadata
		The Other Modules can import the shared modules and use the exported components, directives & pipes
		** The Services must not be defined here.
		The commonly required angular modules like ( CommonModule, FormsModule etc) or third party modules can be imported here and re exported.
	Core Module
		The core module must be imported only in the root module. Other modules must not import the core modules.


======== 014 How an Angular App gets Loaded and Started

		1. Loading the Angular Core Libraries
		2. Loading the Main entry point
		3. Loading the Root Module
		4. Loading the Root Component
		5. Loading the Template

	The Angular finds out about the entry point of our application from the configuration file angular-cli.json
		"index": "index.html",
    "main": "main.ts",      //main
    "test": "test.ts",

		When running ng serve
		src\index.html
			<!doctype html>
			<html>
				<head>...</head>
				<body>
				  <app-root>Loading...</app-root>
				</body>
			</html>

		<app-root> is came from src\app\app.component.ts
			@Component({
			  selector: 'app-root',
			  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
			  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
			})
			export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
			  ...
			}

		src\main.ts is called when Angular get started as bootstrap point:
			import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';
			platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule);

		AppModule is:
			src\app\app.module.ts
			import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
			@NgModule({
			  declarations: [
			    AppComponent
			  ],
			  imports: [
			    BrowserModule,
			    HttpModule,
			    AppRoutingModule,
			    SharedModule,
			    ShoppingListModule,
			    AuthModule,
			    CoreModule
			  ],
			  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
			})
			export class AppModule { }

	src\app\app.component.* is where we start to place our code

	The Every Angular module must have at least one root component.

	Register new component in app.component.ts declarations section

	ng g c componentname


	.angular-cli.json
		Configuration for Angular app


======== Components

	The Components consists of three main building blocks
		Template
		Class
		MetaData (The Metadata is defined with a decorator.)
			Selector
				Selector specifies the simple CSS selector, where our view representing the component is placed by the Angular.
			Providers
				The Providers are the services, that our component going to use. The Services provide service to the Components or to the other Services.
			Directives
				The directives that this component going to use are listed here.

	Remember to Register the new Angular Component to Angular Module

	Component selector
		@Component({
	  	selector: 'app-root',
	  })
	  *.html
	  <body>
			<app-root></app-root>
		</body>

		Using CSS class name
		@Component({
			selector: '.app-root'
		})
		*.html
		<div class="app-root"></div>

		Using attribute name
		@Component({
			selector: '[app-root]'
		})
		*.html
		<div app-root></div>


======== Databinding

	https://www.tektutorialshub.com/angular/angular-data-binding/

	Type of binding:
		Interpolation (One Way Bindings)
		Property Bindings (One Way Bindings)
		Event Bindings (One Way Bindings)
		Two Way Bindings

		Template Expressions
		Template statements

	Template Expression
	export class AppComponent
	{
	    title : string ="app"
	}
	<h1>
    Welcome to {{title}}!
	</h1>
	* The Template expression should not change the state of the application

	Template statement
		Template statement is similar to Template expression but can CHANGE the state of the application.
		Template statements are used in case of Event Bindings.

	String Interpolation - one-way binding (using double curly braces)
		{{ ingredient.name }} ({{ ingredient.amount }}) {{ 'server' }}

		Invoke a method in the component
		<p>{{getTitle()}}</p>

		Bind to the Element Property
		<p style.color={{color}}>This is red</p>

		Interpolation Expression must result in a string. If we return an object it will not work

	Property Binding (using [] square brackets)
		[Property]=”expression”
		The Binding Target is placed inside the square brackets. The Binding source is enclosed in quotes.
		Property binding is one way from Component to the Target in the template.

		<p [innerText]="title"></p>
		<p [innerText]="getTitle()"></p>

		Property Binding Vs Interpolation
		Interpolation requires expression to return a string. If you want to set an element property to a non-string data value, you must use property binding.

	Event Binding (using () parenthesis)
		<button (click)=’ClickPressed()’>
		buttonClicked() : void {
	    this.count=this.count+1;
	    console.log("Button Clicked")
		}

	Two Way Binding by using the ngModel directive
		Two-way binding means that changes made in the component data are propagated to the view and that any changes made in the view are immediately updated in the underlying component data.
		Two-way binding is used mainly in data entry forms

		<input [(ngModel)] =’name’></input>
		Note that both square & parentheses are used here. This is now known as Banana in a box syntax. The square indicates the Property binding & parentheses indicates the event binding.

		@Input 062 Binding to Custom Properties

		@Output/Event: How to publish/subscribe event between components: 064 Binding to Custom Events

		Use Local Reference / ViewChild instead of Two-way binding: 069 Using Local References in Templates, 070 Getting Access to the Template  DOM with ViewChild

		ng-content: 071 Projecting Content into Components with ng-content, 075 Getting Access to ng-content with ContentChild

	The Angular follows component based Architecture

	Angular Pass data to child component
		@Input(): used for parent can pass data into children components
			export class ChildComponent {
			     @Input() count: number;
			}
			OR
		 @Component({
		    selector: 'child-component',
		    inputs: ['count'],
		    template: `<h2>Child Component</h2>
		    current count is {{ count }}
		`
		})
		export class ChildComponent {}

		We can Alias input Property

		How to use ngOnChanges for Change Detection
			export class ChildComponent implements OnChanges {
			    @Input() count: number;
			 
			    ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {
			 			...
			    }
			}

			OR using Input setter
			@Input()
			set count(count: number) {
			    this._count = count;
			    console.log(count);
			}


		There are three ways in which parent component can interact with the child component
			Parent Listens to Child Event
			Parent uses Local Variable to access the child
			Parent uses a @ViewChild to get reference to the child component

		@Output(): used to pass data to parent component
			Child component:
				@Output() countChanged: EventEmitter<number> =   new EventEmitter();
			Parent component:
				<child-component [count]=ClickCounter (countChanged)="countChangedHandler($event)"></child-component>`

		Parent uses local variable to access the Child in Template
			Child component:
				increment() {
	        this.count++;
	      }
			Parent component:
				<child-component #child></child-component>
				<button (click)="child.increment()">Increment</button>

		Parent uses a @ViewChild() to get reference to the Child Component
			Parent component:
				template: <child-component></child-component>
				ts:
					@ViewChild(ChildComponent) child: ChildComponent;
					this.child.increment();


======== Component Life Cycle Hooks in Angular
	Here is the complete list of life cycle hooks provided by the Angular
		ngOnChanges
		ngOnInit
		ngDoCheck
		ngAfterContentInit
		ngAfterContentChecked
		ngAfterViewInit
		ngAfterViewChecked
		ngOnDestroy


======== Directives
	The Angular directive helps us to manipulate the DOM. You can change the appearance, behaviour or a layout of a DOM element using the Directives. They help you to extend HTML
	There are three kinds of directives in Angular:
		Component Directive
		Structural directives
			Structural directives can change the DOM layout by adding and removing DOM elements. All structural Directives are preceded by Asterix symbol
		Attribute directives
			An Attribute or style directive can change the appearance or behaviour of an element.

	Structural directives
		*ngIf, *ngFor
		<tr *ngFor="let movie of movies; let i=index; let o= odd; let e=even;"
			[ngClass]="{ odd: o, even: e }">

		<tr *ngFor="let movie of movies; trackBy:movie?.title;">
		? is known as Safe navigation operator ( Elvis operator )

		We cannot have more than one directive in the same component
		@HostListener to listen to an event from host component
		@HostBinding to bind to a specific attribute of host component

	Attribute directives
		ngModel, ngClass, ngStyle
		<element [ngClass]="'cssClass1 cssClass2'">...</element>
		<div [ngStyle]="{'color': 'blue', 'font-size': '24px', 'font-weight': 'bold'}">
		    some text
		</div>

	Directive property binding:
	@Directive({
  selector: '[appBetterHighlight]'
	})
	export class BetterHighlightDirective implements OnInit {
	  @Input() defaultColor: string = 'transparent';
	  @Input('appBetterHighlight') highlightColor: string = 'blue'; // default binding
	  @HostBinding('style.backgroundColor') backgroundColor: string;

	<p [appBetterHighlight]="'red'" defaultColor="yellow">Style me with a better directive!</p>
	There are two style of binding:
		defaultColor="yellow"
		[defaultColor]="'yellow'"
		<img bind-src="angularLogo"> // add bind-

	The asterisk (*) prefix
	*ngIf will internally be converted to
	<ng-template [ngIf]="..."></ng-template>
	https://angular.io/guide/structural-directives#the-asterisk--prefix


======== Using Pipes to Transform Output
	Angular 2 Pipes helps us to format or transform data to display in our template. They are similar to Filters in AngularJS

	{{ server.instanceType | uppercase }}
	{{ server.started | date:'fullDate' }}
	https://angular.io/api?type=pipe

	pipe can be chained

	Custom pipe:
		@Pipe({
			name: 'shorten'
		})
		export class ShortenPipe implements PipeTransform {
			transform(value: any, arg: number, anotherArg: string) {
				return ...
			}
		}

		{{ server.instanceType | uppercase | shorten:5:'A' }}

		<input type="text" [(ngModel)]='filteredStatus' />
		*ngFor="let server of servers | filter:filteredStatus"

		arg? == arg... in Java

		async pipe :)


======== Using Services & Dependency Injection

	Angular Injector
	@Injectable
	@Inject

	To make it simple to develop application. Instead of using event and binding between components
	Hierarchical Injector:
		A Service is used for current component and all its children components
			App module: application-wide
			App component: app component + its child components. But not available for other services
	@Component({
		providers: [XxxService]
	})
	constructor(private xxx: XxxService) {}

	If we place providers: [XxxService] in child component, it will OVERWRITE the parent service


	https://www.tektutorialshub.com/angular/angular-injector-injectable-inject/
	NOTE:
	The services injected at the module level are app-scoped, which means that they can be accessed from every component/service within the app.Any service provided in the Child Module is available in the entire application.
	The services is provided in a lazy module are module scoped and available only to the lazy loaded module.
	The services provided in the Component level are available only to the Component & and to the child components.

	All the application dependencies are registered with the Providers

	Singleton services
	But if we register the service in @ngModule and also in Component A. The Component A always gets a new instance of the service. While other components gets the instance of the service registered in @ngModule.



======== Changing Pages with Routing

	https://www.tektutorialshub.com/angular/angular-routing-between-modules/

	Components of Router Module:
		Router
		Route
		Routes
		RouterOutlet
			is a directive (<router-outlet>) that serves as a placeholder, where the router should display the view
		RouterLink
			is a directive that binds the HTML element to a Route
		RouterLinkActive
			is a directive for adding or removing classes from an HTML element that is bound to a RouterLink
		ActivatedRoute
			is an object that represents the currently activated route associated with the loaded Component
		RouterState
			current state of the router including a tree of the currently activated routes together with convenience methods for traversing the route tree.
		RouteLink Parameters array
			The Parameters or arguments to the Route

	How to configure Angular Router
		Set the <base href>
			specifies the base URL to use for all relative URLs. The Angular Router uses the HTML5 style of Routing
		Define routes for the view
			app.routes.ts
			export const appRoutes: Routes = [
			  { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent },
			  { path: 'product', component: ProductComponent },
			  { path: '', redirectTo: 'home', pathMatch: 'full' }, // Default route
			  { path: '**', component: ErrorComponent } // Wild Card Route
			];
		Register the Router Service with Routes
			app.module.ts
			imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
		Map HTML Element actions to Route
			<a [routerLink]="['detail',product.productID]">{{product.name}} </a>
		Choose where you want to display the view
			<router-outlet></router-outlet>


	Angular supports two Location Strategies:
		HashLocationStrategy
			Where URL looks like http://localhost:4200/#/product
			imports: [
		    Hashlocationstrategy RouterModule.forRoot(appRoutes, { useHash: true }
			],
		PathLocationStrategy
			Where URL looks like http://localhost:4200/product
			The PathLocationStrategy is the default strategy in Angular 2 application.

	Pass parameters to Angular Route
		{ path: 'product/:id/:id1/:id2', component: ProductDetailComponent }

	ActviatedRoute
		constructor(private _Activatedroute:ActivatedRoute)
		There are two ways in which you can use the ActivatedRoute to get the parameter value
			Using Snapshot
				this.id=this._Activatedroute.snapshot.params['id'];
			Using observable
				ngOnInit() {
			    this.sub=this._Activatedroute.params.subscribe(params => { 
			        this.id = params['id']; 
			        let products=this._productService.getProducts();
			        this.product=products.find(p => p.productID==this.id);    
			      });
			  }
				When the user navigates to the component again, the Angular does not create the new component but reuses the existing instance. By subscribing to the observable params property, you will retrieve the latest value of the parameter and update the component accordingly.
				ngOnDestroy() {
				    this.sub.unsubscribe();
				}

	Child Routes / Nested Routes
		{ path: 'product', component: ProductComponent,
		  children: [
		     { path: 'detail/:id', component: ProductDetailComponent }
		  ],

	Passing Optional (Query) Parameters to a route
		<a [routerLink]="['product']" [queryParams]="{ val1:2 , val2:10}">Whatever</a>
		Programmatically way:
		goToPage(pageNum) {
    	this.router.navigate(['/product'], { queryParams: { page: pageNum } });
		}

		this.sub = this.route.queryParams
	    .subscribe(params => {
	        this.pageNum = +params['pageNum']||0; 
	    });

	Navigating between Angular routes
	You can navigate between routes in Angular 2 in two ways
		Using RouterLink Directive
			<li><a [routerLink]="['product/detail/1']">Product 1 Overview</a></li>
		Via Code
			this._router.navigate(['product/detail/1'])

			this._router.navigate(['detail'], { queryParams: { pageNum: this.pageNum + 1 }, relativeTo: this._Activatedroute } ); // relative path

	Angular Route Guards
	The Angular Router supports Five different guards, which you can use to protect the route
		CanActivate
			decides if a route can be activated (or component gets used). Useful in the circumstance where the user is not authorized to navigate to the target component
		CanDeactivate
			This Guard decides if the user can leave the component. You might ask the user if it’s OK to discard pending changes rather than save them.
		Resolve
			This guard delays the activation of the route until some tasks are completed. You can use the guard to pre-fetch the data from the backend API, before activating the route
		CanLoad
			This guard is used to guard the routes that load feature modules dynamically
		CanActivateChild
			This guard determines whether a child route can be activated.

	Building the Guards are very easy.
		Build the Guard as Service.
			@Injectable()
			export class ProductGuardService implements CanActivate {}
		Implement the Guard Method in the Service
			canActivate(): boolean {    
			    // Check weather the route can be activated;    
			    return true;     
			    // or false if you want to cancel the navigation; 
			}
		Register the Guard Service in the Root Module
			providers: [ProductService,ProductGuardService]
		Update the Routes to use the guards
			{ path: 'product', 
			  component: ProductComponent, 
			  canActivate : [ProductGuardService, AnotherProductGuardService ] 
			}

	---- Udemy
	Setting Routes at app.module.ts but we should extract route setting to separate module
	In *.html
		<router-outlet>
		[routerLink] = "'/edit'"
		[queryParam] {allowEdit: 1}
		[fragment]="'loading'"
		==> http:localhost:3000/edit?allowEdit=1#loading
		/xxx: absolute path
		xxx: relative path
		routerLinkActive="active" (active is a css class)
			exact: true


======== Observables



======== Handling Forms in Angular Apps
	Two approachs:
		Template Driven
		Reactive

	Building Blocks of Angular 2 Forms
		FormControl
		FormGroup
		FormArray

	Some attribute:
		firstname.errors      // returns the list of errors
    firstname.dirty       // true if the value has changed (dirty)
    firstname.touched     // true if input field is touched
    firstname.valid       // true if the input value has passed all the validation

	*** Template Driven ***
	Using FormsModule
	ngForm, ngModel, ngModelGroup
	ngSubmit, #f="ngForm"

	Accessing the Form
		@ViewChild('f')

	We can use value of f in the template

	Submit data to Component
	<form #contactForm="ngForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(contactForm)" >
	onSubmit(contactForm) {
      console.log(contactForm.value);
  }

  Define model - mapping to form control / form group:
  contact:Contact = { 
    firstname:"Sachin",
    lastname:"Tendulkar",
    address: { city:"Mumbai",street:"Perry Cross Rd", pincode:"400050"}
 };

	We can overwrite the css class for error
	app.component.css
		input.ng-invalid.ng-touched {
			border: xxx
		}

	Template Variable - Local reference: #abc

	Setting default value - one way binding:
	[ngModel]="defaultQuestion"
	defaultQuestion is defined in ts file

	Two way binding:
	[(ngModel)]="xxx"

	ngModelGroup="userData"

	Programatically setting value for Form
	*.ts
		this.signupForm.setValue({
			setting value for the WHOLE form
			(mapping by name attribute)
		});
		this.signupForm.patchValue({
			any field
		});

	<div class="form-group">
     <label for="firstname">First Name</label>
     <input type="text" class="form-control" name="firstname"l>
  </div>
  NOTE: The form-group & form-control are CSS Classes from Bootstrap 3. They have nothing to do with Angular 2 FormGroup & FormControl

  Template Driven Forms Validation
  	<input type="text" class="form-control" name="firstname" ngModel #firstname="ngModel" required minlength="10">

  Disabling the Browser (HTML5) validation
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3090369/disable-validation-of-html5-form-elements
  	<form #contactForm="ngForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit(contactForm)" novalidate>

  <button type="submit" [disabled]="!contactForm.valid">Submit</button>

  Display error message
  <input type="text" name="firstname" ngModel required #firstname="ngModel">
  <div *ngIf="!firstname?.valid && (firstname?.dirty ||firstname?.touched)" class="alert alert-danger">
		<div [hidden]="!firstname.errors.required">
			First Name is required
		</div>
	</div>

	*** Reactive approach - Model Driven Forms ***
	The Angular 2 Model Driven Forms enable us to test our forms without being required to rely on end-to-end tests. Easily to write unit Tests
	Using ReactiveFormsModule

	Binding the template to the model and submitting the form
		<form [formGroup]="contactForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()">

	functionAAA.bind(this); to bind this to functionAAA

	We can also use Synchronous validator & Asynchronous validator

	Using FormBuilder
		this.contactForm = this.fb.group({
		    firstname: [],
		    lastname: [],
		    address: this.fb.group({
		       city :[], 
		       street: [],
		       pincode: []
		    })
		});

======== View Encapsulation in Angular
	https://www.tektutorialshub.com/angular/angular-view-encapsulation/
	ViewEncapsulation.Emulated 		// (default)
	ViewEncapsulation.ShadowDOM
	ViewEncapsulation.None


======== Lazy Loading:
	https://www.tektutorialshub.com/angular/angular-lazy-loading/
	In Angular, the Lazy loading works at the module level. i.e. you can lazy load only the Angular Modules. The Individual components cannot be loaded lazily.
	The Lazy loading works via the Angular Router Module. The loadChildren method of the Angular Router is responsible to load the Modules

	We define the modules to be lazy loaded, when we define the routes. 
	 {path: "admin", loadChildren:'./admin/admin.module#AdminModule'},

	Any Service defined in the Lazy Loaded Module, will not be loaded until the user navigates to that module. Hence they cannot be used anywhere else in the application.

	NOTE:
	Do not import lazy loaded modules in any other modules. This will make the angular to load the module eagerly and can have unexpected bugs.
	Be careful when you import other modules in the lazy loaded module. If the other modules providers any services, then the lazy loaded module will get a new instance of the service. This may have unintended side effects, if the services are intended to be app-wide singleton



======== Making Http Requests
	http.post return a observable, therefore, we need to subscribe to it
	post: append new data
	put: replace old data

	We can use pipe | async with http request (observable)

======== Authentication  Route Protection in Angular Apps
	
	Config database permission for only authenticated can read/write

	this.http.get('URL?auth=' + token);

	Routing protection and redirection
		this.router.navigate('...');

		create a new guard implements CanActivate
			canActivate(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot) {
		    return this.authService.isAuthenticated();
		  }
		\src\app\app-routing.module.ts
		 { path: 'new', component: RecipeEditComponent, canActivate: [AuthGuard] },


======== Using Angular Modules & Optimizing Apps
	Feature Modules ==> Module by Feature
	@NgModule
	Rule: Only call *.forRoot(...) in App Root module
	In child module, call: *.forChild(...)

	Shared Modules:
		Tomake some declarations are able to use from outside, we need to exports them
	Feature Modules should not export imported modules outside

	Lazy Loading
		There are some modules that may not be touched, so we can use lazy loading to prevent all modules to be downloaded at the begining.
		1. Remove Module from imports
		2. { path: 'recipes', loadChildren: './recipes/recipes.module#RecipesModule'},		
		Result:
			chunk.js is only load at the point of time we need it.

		If you provide a Service in Lazy loaded Module, it will create a child instance that different from the rest of application

		Don't provide Services in Shared Module!!! Because it is still lazy loaded in lazy component

		Move Service providers from App module to Core module

		Just-in-time 									vs 	Ahead-of-Time compilation
		Compile Template on Browser 			Compile Template when building

		ng build --prod --aot
		output to dist folder

		Preloading lazy loaded routes
			(after app has loaded and having free time)
		\src\app\app-routing.module.ts
		@NgModule({
		  imports: [
		    RouterModule.forRoot(appRoutes, {preloadingStrategy: PreloadAllModules})
		  ],
		  exports: [RouterModule]
		})

======== Deploying an Angular App

	Step:
		Build with --proc mode
		Consider AoT compilation
		Set correct <base> element because there is a case that Angular app is not run on root domain but nested domain
		Make sure Server ALWAYS returns index.html

	Deploy on AWS S3:
		Static Website Hosting
			Index Document: index.html
			Error Document: index.html
		Permission:
			Grant read-only permission for guest
		index.html (in case need to change <base>)
			<base href="/">
		Build --proc --aot
		Upload all files under built package (dist folder)
		DONE


======== State Management - Working with NgRx in our Project

	State management
		Service vs NgRx? It depend
	https://blog.nrwl.io/managing-state-in-angular-applications-22b75ef5625f

	Service is suitable for small application. When application grow, it will cause complexibility of communication direction.
	Instead of that, we can use centralized approach: Redux


	*********** KEY TO TAKE AWAY ***********
	Using SERVICE to handle logic, communicate with back-end and other services, API
	Using STATE management (Redux) to store the state using in application's components

	export function shoppingListReducer(state = initialState, action: ShoppingListActions.ShoppingListActions) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case ShoppingListActions.ADD_INGREDIENT:
      return {	// return new object
        ...state,	// include all properties in state
        ingredients: [...state.ingredients, action.payload] // modify ingredients properties to add more data (action.payload)
      };
    case ShoppingListActions.ADD_INGREDIENTS:
      return {
        ...state,
        ingredients: [...state.ingredients, ...action.payload]
      };
    ...

    Union type:
    export type ShoppingListActions =
  		AddIngredient |
  		AddIngredients;
    https://blog.angulartraining.com/union-types-in-typescript-2517a82a1ea0

    store.select('xxx');	// xxx is reducer name, return the state of that reducer

    Side effects: - pure function must not change the state. if it does, we get side effects

    Ngrx effects
		So what is a side effect? Its piece of code that catches our Actions more or less the same way as our reducers do, but instead of changing something in our state, they actually send API requests and, on the result, dispatch new Actions.
		So, “evaluation of the result does not cause any semantically observable side effect or output, such as mutation of mutable objects or output to I/O devices”

    Solve side effect: 324 A Closer Look at Effects
    	auth.effects.ts

   	Only dispatch action (to change application state/store) from component.ts, not from service: it cause side effect???

    Redux for Lazy load component:

    	TODO



======== Angular Universal
	Client side rendering: Client render HTML page by JS => cannot optimize for Search engine
	Server side rendering: Server render HTML by JS and response to Client. Note: lazy initializing
	https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/stories-universal-rendering
		Lazy load component? But it will come soon
		Never directly access to the DOM, because on Server side, there is no DOM

======== TypeScript Introduction (for Angular 2 Usage)

	Interface
	http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html
		function printLabel(labelledObj: { label: string }) {
		    console.log(labelledObj.label);
		}

		let myObj = {size: 10, label: "Size 10 Object"};
		printLabel(myObj);

		==>
		interface LabelledValue {
   			label: string;
		}

		function printLabel(labelledObj: LabelledValue) {
		    console.log(labelledObj.label);
		}

		let myObj = {size: 10, label: "Size 10 Object"};
		printLabel(myObj);

		Interface can also have method()
		interface ClockInterface {
		    tick();
		}

	Class
		Parameter properties
		class Octopus {
		    readonly numberOfLegs: number = 8;
		    constructor(readonly name: string) {
		    }
		}

		Getter/Setter
		let passcode = "secret passcode";

		class Employee {
		    private _fullName: string;

		    get fullName(): string {
		        return this._fullName;
		    }

		    set fullName(newName: string) {
		        if (passcode && passcode == "secret passcode") {
		            this._fullName = newName;
		        }
		        else {
		            console.log("Error: Unauthorized update of employee!");
		        }
		    }
		}

		let employee = new Employee();
		employee.fullName = "Bob Smith";
		if (employee.fullName) {
		    console.log(employee.fullName);
		}

		Abstract class
		abstract class Animal {
		    abstract makeSound(): void;
		    move(): void {
		        console.log("roaming the earth...");
		    }
		}

		Generic:
		function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
		    return arg;
		}

		let output = identity<string>("myString");  // type of output will be 'string'

		Enum
		enum Response {
		    No = 0,
		    Yes = 1,
		}
